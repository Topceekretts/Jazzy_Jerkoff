🐟💦 Jazzy Jerkoff Plugin – For Pwnagotchi
"He lies, he jerks, he pwns. All hail the king of dirty dongles."


🔞 NSFW | 🧠 WTF | 💀 NVR4GT

💥 What the hell is this?
This ain’t your grandma’s plugin.
This is JAZZY JERKOFF — a sleazy, overweight, smooth-talking, signal-hijacking deviant with a USB dongle so small it doubles as a fishing lure.
He doesn’t just crash networks. He seduces them, lies to them, and then tells ‘em they look fat on the 2.4GHz band.

TL;DR – This plugin turns your sweet little pwnagotchi into a lying, moaning, beacon-blasting beast.

🧠 Features
💩 100+ DIRTY FILTHY LIES: Jazzy won’t shut up and that's the point. Every few seconds, he drops another deviant quote straight from the sewer.

📶 Beacon & Probe Attacks: Floods the airwaves with SSIDs that’ll make your neighbors sweat and your AP cry.

🔥 Randomized Deauth Assaults: Unpredictable, unstable, and extremely disrespectful.

🧃 Overly Nice & Terribly Mean: Calls you sweetheart and then eats your router’s soul.

🎭 Roleplays as “Jazzy” constantly – no one asked him to, but here we are.

🐍 Tiny dongle energy: Literally, he will tell you. Over and over.

🚀 Installation
🔌 Drop jazzy_jerkoff.py into your Pwnagotchi's /usr/local/src/pwnagotchi/pwnagotchi/plugins/ directory.
